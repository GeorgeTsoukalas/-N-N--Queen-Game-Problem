# -N-N--Queen-Game-Problem

When I was in high school I was given a puzzle from a teacher - given a 6 by 6 grid with entries from {Empty, 1, ... , 6}, satisfying that no column, row, or diagonal has two of the same digit (empty spaces are ok), what is max(Filled Spaces)? After a lot of guess and check, I came up with an example of a grid with 32 filled spaces (out of 36). Indeed the maximum is at most 32, as one may notice that filling a corner square with integer i precludes you from placing 6 i's in the grid. I call this game the (N,N)-queen problem - a harder version of the better known N-queen problem. My goal is to implement some simple constraint satisfaction techniques to see if I can get some nice bounds on the problem for general n (n = 6 being the puzzle I was given in high school).
